# GenLottery -> lottery-generator.py
A lottery number generator (a python learning project) - Command line and GUI enabled

See lottery-generator.py --help

Generate a variety of Lottery numbers, the current types of lottery available in the UK from http://national-lottery.co.uk are catered for, however other lotteries may be specified;
    in particular see LOTTERY_TYPES and RULES in constants.py.

The generated numbers may be saved to a file and read from the file.

The majority of settings are set out in constants.py
The GUI is generated using PySimpleGUI

As a first attempt at a python project I expect that I have made many non-Pythonistic choices and I'm happy to learn from my mistakes.
